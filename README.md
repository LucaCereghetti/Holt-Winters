# Holt-Winters Forecasting â€“ Theory and Implementation

This repository provides both the **theoretical explanation** and the **practical implementation** of the Holt-Winters exponential smoothing method, applied to financial time series data.

## Repository Structure

- **1 - Data explanation.pdf**  
  Overview of the dataset and how the data is prepared for forecasting.

- **2 - Holt_Winters.pdf**  
  Theoretical background of the Holt-Winters exponential smoothing method, including level, trend, and seasonality components.

- **3 - Performance Metrics.pdf**  
  Explanation of the statistical metrics used to evaluate forecast accuracy.

- **Holt-winters - Thesis.R**  
  R script implementing the Holt-Winters forecasting method, including model fitting, forecasting, and evaluation.

- **AAPL_prices.csv**  
  Sample dataset (Apple Inc. stock price data) used in the analysis.

- **LICENSE, .gitignore, .gitattributes**  
  Standard repository and configuration files.

## How to Use
1. Read the PDFs to understand the **theoretical aspects** of Holt-Winters and the evaluation metrics.  
2. Open and run `Holt-winters - Thesis.R` in R to replicate the implementation.  
3. Use `AAPL_prices.csv` as input data for forecasting experiments.  

---

ðŸ“Œ **Key idea:** The PDFs provide the **theoretical foundation**, while the R script demonstrates the **practical forecasting workflow**.
